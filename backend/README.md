## Getting Started On Backend

*NOTE: You need an `OPENAI_API_KEY` and a `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to run this code. Store them in a `.env` file in the `backend` folder, or set them as environment variables.*

*If you have trouble using api keys above, please contact [me](https://github.com/CaptainHPY).*

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the server:
